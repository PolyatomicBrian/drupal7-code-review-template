# Drupal 7 Code Review

This project is intended to be a starting point and a guide when performing a
code review of a Drupal 7 module (contrib or core).

There are no silver bullets when it comes to performing a code review. The
best results are produced when a variety of methods are employed by a skilled
reviewer.

This project is sponsored by the [School of Arts and Sciences][2] at the
[University of Pennsylvania][1]
