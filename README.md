# Drupal 7 Code Review

This project is intended to be a starting point and a guide when performing a
code review of a Drupal 7 module (contrib or core).

There are no silver bullets when it comes to performing a code review. The
best results are produced when a variety of methods are employed by a skilled
reviewer.

This project is sponsored by the [School of Arts and Sciences][2] at the
[University of Pennsylvania][1]


## What's Included

- Scripts

    These should be used to help learn more about the module before looking at
    a single line of code. This is only the first step.

- Docs

    - Project documentation
    - Drupal module threat modeling

- Example review

    An example review will be included to demonstrate the use of the various
    components included in this project.
