# Creating a Vulnerability Report

Write up a vulnerability report (a sample report has been included,
Demo-VulnReport-flag.md). This is the type of document that we submit to the
Drupal Security team. At a minimum the report should include the following
sections:

- Date
- Author
- Brief description of vulnerability
- Systems affected
- Potential impacts
- Mitigating factors (such as required configurations or privileges to exploit)
- Proof of concept instructions or program
- Patch
